- This is a random unordered list
- I wish I could buy God of War Ragnarok
- This repository contains the culmination of what I have learned applied to the "about" page of my old Websites4beginners project. 
- A lot of love went into this project and at the end of the day....for the first time in quite a while I can say that I am proud of what
  I was able to develop with the tools and instruction that was available to me. 
- A BIG thanks to Coby Fielding and Tyler Funa for all the assistance and dedication they gave to the mobile friendly class, for everyone in my cohort
  who contributed to my success, and of course...Bitwise Industries as a whole!
